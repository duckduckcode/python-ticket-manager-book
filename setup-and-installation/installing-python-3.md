# Installing Python 3

It is important to make sure that you use Python3 for this course, as some of the code is not compatible with Python2. You need to install Python3, test that it worked, and find which command you need to use to run your Python3 projects.


## Installation

1. Download Python3 from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. During installation, check the box "Add Python3 to PATH"


## Find Your Python Command

1. Open a new command line window
2. Type `python -V` (that is a capital V!)
3. Press Enter

Take a look at the output on your command line:

- **If your terminal says `Python 3.?.?`:**<br>
  Your python "run" command for the rest of this course is `python`.

- **If your terminal says `Python 2.?.?`:**<br>
  You probably have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed! That's okay, but let's make sure you   can choose to run Python 3.

  In your command line, type `python3 -V` (note the 3 after python!)

  **If your terminal now says `Python 3.?.?`:**
  Your python "run" command for the rest of this course is `python3`.



## What's Next

**By now you should:**

- Have Python3 installed and added to your PATH
- Know which command you should use to run Python3 programs

Examples will use `python` as the Python run command. Use `python3` instead if needed.
