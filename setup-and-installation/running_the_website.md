# Running the Website

Bottle websites need to run on a **local server**. Plain HTML and CSS websites can be opened directly in a web browser, but Bottle needs a web server so that the Python parts can run.

Running your Bottle app automatically starts a web server.

## Starting the Site

In your command line:

- Type `python website.py`
- Press Enter

Open the address `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser. You should see "Hello!".


## Stopping the Site

Most of the time you can just leave the site running. You can stop the site if something goes wrong or if you want to change some launch settings.

In your command line:

- Press Ctrl + C

This will shut down the web server, so your website will no longer load in a web browser.


## Reloading Changes

Bottle automatically updates your site with any changes you make. You will need to press the "Refresh" button in your browser to see the changes.

If your changes are not updating, try stopping your web server and starting it again.
