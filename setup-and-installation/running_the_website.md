# Running the Website

Bottle websites need to run on a **local server**. Plain HTML and CSS websites can be opened directly in a web browser, but Bottle needs a web server so that the Python parts can run.

Running your Bottle app suatomatically starts a web server.

## Starting the Site

In your command line:

- Type `python website.py`
- Press Enter

Open the address `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser. You should see "Hello!".


## Stopping the Site

You may like to stop the site if something goes wrong or if you want to change some launch settings, but most of the time you can just leave it running.

In your command line:

- Press Ctrl + C

Your website should no long load in a web browser as the web server should have shut down.


## Reloading Changes

Bottle automatically updates your site with any changes you make. You will need to press the "Refresh" button in your browser to see the changes.

If your changes are not updating, try stopping your web server and starting it again.
