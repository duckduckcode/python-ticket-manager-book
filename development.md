# Development

As you develop your project, be sure to record each achievement or setback in your work log. You may also update your visual flow or data flow as you go.

Your project must meet the following technical requirements:

* The application must run

* The project must meet the brief

* There must be more than one form of user input

* There must be program output

* Your code must be well-commented

* You must include functions with parameters

* You must write and use a Python class

* You must include a Python-based list

* You must use a conditional statement

* You must use a loop


## Running Application

The person assessing your work must be able to use the application for its intended purpose, without it crashing or showing any errors.

## Meet the Brief

You must fulfil all the requirements of the brief, without over-delivering. Complete the project to the best of your ability without adding in extras which were not asked for by the client.

## User Input

This can be defined as form input, clicks and navigation. If you choose to add JavaScript and you add your own code to respond to user interactions then that code is also eligible.

## Output

The program has "output" by definition, but make sure to include some output which is based on values captured from user input.

## Comments

Remember that you can use comments in all languages used in this project. Comment your HTML where it would be helpful, your CSS when the naming or purpose could do with some clarity, your Python to explain your logic, and your JavaScript too if you choose to do any. Comments should help someone unfamiliar with your project understand what the code does, and why.

## Functions with Parameters

You'll need to ensure that there are functions in your code where you pass in at least one parameter and then use it sensibly within the function. The best example of this is a route which can accept route parameters.

## Python Class

You need to design and code a class for use in your app. The class needs to be written in Python - we're not talking about CSS classes or JavaScript classes! You also need to use that class to create multiple instances of the object it describes.

## Python List

You must include in your app some data which is stored in a list. It has to be a Python list, not just an HTML list, though you can print out the Python list as an HTML list in the app if you want to.

## Conditional Statement

You must use an "if" statement somewhere in your code. It may be in a Python function as you would traditionally use one. It may also be in an HTML template, using Bottle's Python-based template language.

## Loop

You must use a loop somewhere in your code. It may be in a Python function as you would traditionally use one. It may also be in an HTML template, using Bottle's Python-based template language.
