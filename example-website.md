# Sample Project

Create a web app for managing event check-ins, with support for both pre-bought tickets and door sales. This app provides a list of attendees, their ticket type and their status. View live stats on total income, the people already checked in to your event, and the number of people who havenâ€™t yet arrived.

This workshop is suitable for students who have successfully studied programming with Python at level 2 or above.

## Technical overview
Create a complex program which has a graphical interface. It should take user input and do some processing to create a visual output. 

The program needs to be coded clearly and thoughtfully. It must demonstrate event handling, the use of an indexed data structure, the use of a class to store data and functionality, and programming control structures including loops and conditional statements. 

The code must be well-documented using code comments and should be tested for all input cases including expected, boundary and invalid cases.
