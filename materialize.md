# Materialize

This code library offers a bunch of pre-written CSS and JavaScript that we can very easily apply to our own HTML pages. Their website has examples of all their components, and you are free to use as many or as few of them as you like.

There are 3 levels of using Materialize. The first level is CSS-only, so you can add style to your app. The second level is CSS with icon fonts, so you can use icons in your app. The third level is CSS + Icons + JavaScript, which enables interactivity on some elements.
