# Standard Breakdown

## Program Specifications

The program must have:

- A modular structure with parameters
- An indexed data structure
- Input and Output
- Conditionals
- Loops

## Achieved

The requirements for Achieved are:

- **Implement a Plan**
  The program must meet the requirements set out in the project brief.
- **Clear and commented code**
  The purpose of the code must be clear and there must be comments to describe the code's purpose.
- **Test and debug on expected input**
  The student must show evidence of testing the program's expected behaviour. A video of the testing process is recommended.


## Merit

The additional requirements for Merit are:

- **Independently implement a plan**
  The program must be developed without direct guidance from a teacher or peer. Discussion and feedback is allowed. Detailed guidance or instruction with respect to the project may not be given.
- **Well-scoped variables**
  Variables should be located within functions where logical, and only placed in a "global" location when needed.
- **Well-chosen parameters**
  Parameters passed into functions should be well-named and sensible for the purpose of the function.
- **Accurate and descriptive comments**
  Comments should represent the current state of the code and accurately describe the code's purpose and functionality.
- **Organised testing and debugging for expected and boundary cases**
  A test plan must be designed and implemented. The test plan should address the program's expected input and also any boundary cases which may be present.


## Excellence

The additional requirements for Excellence are:

- **Logical decomposition of the task**
  ???
- **Flexible and robust program**
  The program should be easily adapted by modifying key elements, such as lists of items or key values. It should be clear where to make these changes in the code, and the program should correctly use the changes.
- **Concise code**
  The code should be readable and should display evidence of re-use over repetition wherever possible.
- **Comments that explain and justify**
  Comments should describe why a certain approach is used. They should help the reader to understand the purpose and intention of the code rather than just a plain-text description of what the code does.
- **Comprehensive testing and debugging for expected, boundary and invalid cases**
  A test plan must be designed and implemented. The test plan should address the program's expected, boundary, and invalid cases.
