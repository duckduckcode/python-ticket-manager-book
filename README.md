# Python Websites with Bottle

This course will guide you through creating a basic Python-backed website. You will need previous experience with HTML and CSS for the "front end" of your website. Python will form the "back-end" of the website, allowing you to capture user input and do processing on that input.

## Technical Overview
Create a complex program which has a graphical interface. It should take user input and do some processing to create a visual output. 

The program needs to be coded clearly and thoughtfully. It must demonstrate event handling, the use of an indexed data structure, the use of a class to store data and functionality, and programming control structures including loops and conditional statements. 

The code must be well-documented using code comments and should be tested for all input cases including expected, boundary and invalid cases.

This project is suitable for students who have successfully studied programming with Python at level 2 or above.
