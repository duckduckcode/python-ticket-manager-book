# Planning

Your planning documents should record your thought process and should record the evolution of your project over time. All documents can be updated during development of your app, but changes should be recorded where possible.

Before you begin coding, create the following documents:

* Work Log
* Visual Flow Diagram
* Data Flow Diagram
* Test Plan

## Work Log

Begin logging immediately. Write a very brief record of what you achieved \(or didn't achieve\) each time you do some work on your project. Record everything, no matter how small. Bullet points are acceptable.

## Visual Flow Diagram

This may be hand drawn or computer generated. It may be reviewed and changed during development of your project, but you must do a plan before beginning.

## Data Flow Diagram

This may be hand drawn or computer generated. It may be reviewed and changed during development of your project, but you must do a plan before beginning.

## Test Plan

This must be clear and easy to follow for a person unfamiliar with your project. It may be reviewed and changed during development of your project, but you must record as many known tests as possible before beginning.

Think about all the things you could break, or that someone could do wrong. Document them all!
