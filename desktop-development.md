# Desktop Development

These instructions will guide you through getting started with Bottle development using your own computer. Developing on the desktop instead of online means that you can do work without an Internet connection. The downside is that if you lose your computer or can't access it for some reason, your work is gone too. The up-side is that this is a more "real-world" way of writing code, and through configuring your computer you may learn a thing or two about how it works.

## Install Python 3

* Download Python3 from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* During installation, tick the box "Add Python3 to PATH" or "Add to environment variables"

## Find Your Python Command

* Open a new command line window
* Type `python3 -V` \(that is a capital V!\) and press enter
* If it says `Python 3.?.?` then Python is working correctly
* Note: some computers will need you to use just `python` instead of `python3`

## Install Bottle

* In your shell type \`pip install bottle\` and press enter
* Wait for the installer to complete
