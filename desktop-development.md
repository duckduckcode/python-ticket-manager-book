# Desktop Development

These instructions will guide you through getting started with Bottle development using your own computer. Developing on the desktop instead of online means that you can do work without an Internet connection.

The downside is that if you lose your computer or can't access it for some reason, your work is gone too. The up-side is that this is a more "real-world" way of writing code, and through configuring your computer you may learn a thing or two about how it works.

## Install Python 3

* Download Python3 from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* During installation, tick the box "Add Python3 to PATH" or "Add to environment variables"

## Find Your Python Command

* Open a new command line window
* Type `python3 -V` \(that is a capital V!\) and press enter
* If it says `Python 3.?.?` then Python is working correctly
* Note: some computers will need you to use just `python` instead of `python3`

## Install Bottle

* In your shell type \`pip3 install bottle\` and press enter
* Wait for the installer to complete
* If it didn't work try \`pip install bottle\` instead

Bottle is a Python module which has support for running websites with Python. It lets us do some Python processing in the background, then show those results in our HTML pages.

Pip is a command line app just like Python, and is installed automatically when you install Python. Pip is what's known as a "module manager". Modules are like plugins which add extra functionality to Python. You can use Pip to install Python modules that other developers have published to the Pip database. Bottle is a Python module, so we can install it using Pip.

## Install Visual Studio Code

* Download from [http://code.visualstudio.com](http://code.visualstudio.com)
* Run the Installer
* Open VS Code to check that it installed correctly
* Open the Integrated terminal \( Ctrl + \` \)
* Try `python -V`
* If it doesn't work, try `py -V`

VS Code is a free, lightweight code editor created by Microsoft. It works on all operating systems and supports most major programming languages. Visual Studio Code is not the same as Visual Studio. If you already have Visual Studio installed, you will still need to install Visual Studio Code.
